Keep all the code in a single html file.
The html file includes all the html, Javascript and css code needed to run the application.
The application should not depend on any external javascript library.
The state for the application is stored in the browser local storage.
The application needs to be built so that saving and loading just means serializing and deserializing the state.
The majority of the UI should be in the html.
Is a part of the UI needs to be hidden, use a css class dynamically applied to achieve it.
If the html is to be generated dynamically, the javascript code should modify the existing html instead of generating the whole UI from scratch.
The UI should look professional.
The UI should be as compact as possible so that it works on the screen of a typical phone.
